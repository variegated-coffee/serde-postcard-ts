# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Completed the fix for `InferType<T>` that was partially addressed in v0.1.2. The v0.1.2 fix added structural typing to the Schema union but forgot to include the `_type` property in those structural types, causing `InferType` to still return `never`.
- Added `readonly _type?: any` to all structural schema types in the Schema union (option, newtype_struct, seq, tuple, tuple_struct, map, struct, enum).
- Updated `InferType` implementation to check for optional `_type?` property instead of required `_type` property to match the structural types.

### Added

- Comprehensive compile-time type inference tests in `tests/types/infer-type-compile-time.test.ts` that verify `InferType<T>` returns correct types and never returns `never`.
- Added 11 new compile-time type checking tests (total now 356 tests, was 345).

### Changed

- InferType conditional type now checks for `readonly _type?: infer T` instead of `readonly _type: infer T` to properly handle optional phantom type properties.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed TypeScript variance issue that caused `InferType<T>` to return `never` for all generic schema types. The v0.1.1 fix only addressed schema assignment but missed the primary API (`InferType`) which uses generic constraints. This was a blocking bug that made the library unusable for type inference on complex schemas.
- Applied structural typing to all generic schema types in the Schema union: `OptionSchema`, `NewtypeStructSchema`, `SeqSchema`, `TupleSchema`, `TupleStructSchema`, `MapSchema`, and `StructSchema`.
- Updated serializer and deserializer to properly handle the new structural types with appropriate type casts.

### Added

- Comprehensive `InferType` tests for all generic schema types to prevent regression.
- Added 22 new tests (total now 345 tests, was 323).
- Added `npm run type-check:tests` script to verify type inference works correctly.

### Changed

- Schema union type now uses structural typing with `any` for all generic type parameters to handle TypeScript variance correctly.
- All generic schemas can now be properly used with `InferType<T>` to get correct TypeScript types.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript type compatibility issue where `EnumSchema` instances created with `enumType()` could not be assigned to the `Schema` type. The Schema union type now accepts enum schemas with specific variant object types (e.g., `{ Active: ..., Inactive: ... }`) instead of only the generic `Record<string, EnumVariant>` type.

### Changed

- Modified `Schema` type definition to use structural typing for enum schemas, improving type variance handling while maintaining runtime type safety through the `enumType()` function.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-25
